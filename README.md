## What is Smart Health Assistant

Smart Health Assistant is a mobile app which provides a solution to the hassle of scheduling doctor appointments.

It uses a Machine Learning model to help patients consult doctors based on the symptoms faced by them

- Scope of the Project

  The app was designed to be a software solution for a particular hospital's OPD department and manage all the doctor appointments attached to that hospital.

## How it works?

The Smart Health Assistant is made using Flutter and Firebase as the database. It has 3 main modules to it.

    1. Doctor Module
    The Doctor module is completely handled by the Admin team of the hospital.

    2. Patient Module
    The Patient Module has some functions like booking appointments, viewing doctor schedule, cancelling appointments, revieweing past appointments.

    3. Chatbot Prediction System
    The Chatbot offers the patient to diagnose themself like WebMD and further directs the patient to a particular department of the OPD where they can consult a particular doctor.

The [Chatbot Prediction System](https://github.com/shantanugodbole/Disease-Predictor) was developed as a standalone module which was integrated into the app.
